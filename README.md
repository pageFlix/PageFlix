# PageFlix
PageFlix aims to make libraries more accessible to customers. The system maintains a list of registered libraries, each of which can manage its book inventory and track real-time book rentals in the application.

For library management, each library can view its book inventory, track books that have been borrowed, and identify which customer currently has a particular book.
